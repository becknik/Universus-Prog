# volatile

## Why does it exist
- Hint the compiler not to make only-read-once optimizations to the declared variable, due to the variable being written to by other entities [^1]
	â†’ Every time the variable is accessed in the source code, this variable actually gets read by the instructions generated by the compiler
- May be useful for accessing a variable another entity is constantly writing

## Use Cases
- Memory mapped I/O
- Something on [[../../../../../../Uni/SysKon/Betriebssystem/Funktionen/System Calls|ISRs]]
