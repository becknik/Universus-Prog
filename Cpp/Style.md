# Style
â†’ [[Style/Best Practices|Best Practices]]
- Always initialize entities
- Use underscores for variables specifiers & underscores/ intercaps for methods
- identifiers starting with "\_" are usually reserved for OS
- Functions always must have a return statement, unless undefined behavior is asked
